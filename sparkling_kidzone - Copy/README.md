# Sparkling Kidzone — Starter Website

This is a simple, responsive static starter website built for your kids clothing brand "Sparkling Kidzone".
It includes:
- `index.html` — the main page
- `styles.css` — modern, responsive CSS
- `script.js` — sample product data injection
- `assets/` — placeholder SVGs used as images

How to use:
1. Unzip the `sparkling_kidzone.zip`.
2. Open the folder in VS Code.
3. Open `index.html` in a browser or use the "Live Server" extension for hot reload.

You're free to modify images, copy, and layout. If you'd like a React + Tailwind version or a Shopify/Shopify theme skeleton, tell me which and I'll create it next.
